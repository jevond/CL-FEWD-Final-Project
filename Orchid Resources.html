       			<h3>Where can I buy Orchids?</h3>
       			<p>You can find orchids all over the place for sale. The Phal orchids are going to be the ones you find most ofter- they're sold in most grocery/home supply stores and florists. The other species and genus of orchids are a little harder to find. Some of the not so common orchids will be availible at botanical gardens and at orchid society meetings. There is a great orchid show and sale in Louisville every October that is hosted by the Kentucky Orchid Society that is a great place to find the more less common orchids.</p>
      			 <p>You can also find orchids for sale on line. There you can find numerous different species that you wouldn't find in a store. Be careful though - some sellers arent completely honest and you should definitely check out any reviews before committing to purchasing an orchid from an online vendor.</p>

       			<h3>Where can I get materials for growing Orchids?</h3>
       			<p>There are numerous websites that sell different materials needed for growing healthy orchids. Below you can find links to a few different websites that have a wide variety of products for different species of orchids.</p>
